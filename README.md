Project is inspired by the Cerebras interface. LearnLens – Focused Insights from PDFs. It's simple: Upload, Query and Excel. 

LearnLens is application that allows users to upload PDF documents, interactively query the content, and create personalized study questions to enhance understanding. It also includes a summarization tool to simplify complex materials, making them more accessible to a wide range of audiences, especially for difficult content like academic papers or technical articles.

Cerebras for the opportunity to play around with their APIs

## Further Insights
For future improvements,one key area is improving accessibility—specifically, by integrating an audio version of the queries and summaries. This would allow users to engage with the content more easily, particularly for those with visual impairments or who prefer auditory learning. Another planned feature is multilingual support, which would enable users to translate documents into different languages. This could benefit people who need to understand complex documents, such as medical records, legal documents, or academic papers, in their native language. Additionally, exploring language-learning applications, where users can upload worksheets or reading material and have them translated and simplified for better comprehension. A Chatbot can also be integrated recommended similar articles or people who can collab on projects. Another way to incorporate uploading PDFs could be uploading pictures of food to generate recipes or upload recipes and recommend simpler ones to make.
